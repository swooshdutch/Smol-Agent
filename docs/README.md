## Key Features

*   **üß† Persistent Memory:** A tiered memory system (STM, MTM, LTM) allows the agent to learn and recall information across sessions.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Tool Use:** Teach the agent to read, write, and edit files in its sandboxed directory to manage notes, write code, or build a knowledge base.
*   **üé® Fully Customizable:** You define the agent's core identity, goals, and rules through a powerful and user-friendly prompting system.
*   **üöÄ Autonomous Operation:** An "Auto-Turn" feature allows the agent to work on tasks independently without requiring constant user input.
*   **üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech:** The agent can speak its responses aloud using your operating system's built-in voices.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   A Google Gemini API Key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Installation

Clone this repository, then install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

`pip install google-generativeai`

`pip install pyttsx3`

`pip install pythoncom`
*(Note: `pythoncom` is part of `pywin32`. On non-Windows systems, this dependency may not be required.)*

### 3. Run the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run:

`python main.py`

On first launch, the app will create all necessary directories and default prompts. You will need to enter your Google Gemini API key via the **API > Set Google Gemini API Key...** menu.
